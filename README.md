# NightScape

## What is it?
NightScape, is a landing page based of the chrome extention [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/). The backgound switches according to the time 
of day and you can dynamically put in your name and your focus for today! You can put this on a website or make it into an extention.
